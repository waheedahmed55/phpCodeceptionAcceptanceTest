On top of the general feedback, bug fixes and roadmap there's a few other things that need work.

* **Test Results**: There's no interaction/link between the test list and the results in the console. I might remove the console and put the resolves in a hover-modal instead. 

* **Improved Error Handling**: The UI for showing errors is a bit shaky. It could be better, which would be fixed as part of...

* **Re-implement the Javascript in AngularJS**: Whilst the current Javascript is straight forward for the current feature-set, it likely won't scale as it grows. So, hopefully re-implementing it in AngularJS will likely solve that problem.

* **Branding Webception**. The CSS for Webpcetion is pure Foundation with no changes, so it's very basic. I'd like to eventually brand it a little more.
